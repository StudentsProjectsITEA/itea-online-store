Preparing project
-------------------

The first steps after pulling the project to the local machine:

1. Open a console terminal and install all Composer requirements:
```
composer install
```
2. Execute the `init` command:
```
php init --env=Development --overwrite=All
```
3. Run the command in terminal one by one to create database:
```
sudo -u postgres psql postgres
# CREATE USER "store-admin" WITH PASSWORD 'itea1234';
# CREATE DATABASE store_db WITH OWNER "store-admin";
# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE store_db to "store-admin";
# \quit
sudo systemctl restart postgresql
```
4. Adjust the `components['db']` configuration in file `/common/config/main-local.php` like a:
```
'db' => [
    'class' => 'yii\db\Connection',
    'dsn' => 'pgsql:host=localhost;dbname=store_db',
    'username' => 'store-admin',
    'password' => 'itea1234',
    'charset' => 'utf8',
],
```
5. Open a console terminal, apply migrations with command:
```
php yii migrate
```
4. Configure the virtual host for Nginx and create empty log files like a `access_log` and `error_log` sections:
```
server {
    charset utf-8;
    client_max_body_size 128M;

    listen 80; ## listen for ipv4
    #listen [::]:80 default_server ipv6only=on; ## listen for ipv6

    server_name online-store.site;
    root        /home/username/projects/online-store/frontend/web/;
    index       index.php;

    access_log  /home/username/projects/online-store/frontend/runtime/logs/frontend-access.log;
    error_log   /home/username/projects/online-store/frontend/runtime/logs/frontend-error.log;

    location / {
        # Redirect everything that isn't a real file to index.php
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php$is_args$args;
    }

    # uncomment to avoid processing of calls to non-existing static files by Yii
    location ~ \.(js|css|png|jpg|gif|swf|ico|pdf|mov|fla|zip|rar)$ {
        try_files $uri =404;
    }
    error_page 404 /404.html;

    # deny accessing php files for the /assets directory
    location ~ ^/assets/.*\.php$ {
        deny all;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        include fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        #fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.3-fpm.sock;
        try_files $uri =404;
    }

    location ~* /\. {
        deny all;
    }
}
 
server {
    charset utf-8;
    client_max_body_size 128M;

    listen 80; ## listen for ipv4
    #listen [::]:80 default_server ipv6only=on; ## listen for ipv6

    server_name admin.online-store.site;
    root        /home/username/projects/online-store/backend/web/;
    index       index.php;

    access_log  /home/username/projects/online-store/backend/runtime/logs/backend-access.log;
    error_log   /home/username/projects/online-store/backend/runtime/logs/backend-error.log;

    location / {
        # Redirect everything that isn't a real file to index.php
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php$is_args$args;
    }

    # uncomment to avoid processing of calls to non-existing static files by Yii
    location ~ \.(js|css|png|jpg|gif|swf|ico|pdf|mov|fla|zip|rar)$ {
        try_files $uri =404;
    }
    error_page 404 /404.html;

    # deny accessing php files for the /assets directory
    location ~ ^/assets/.*\.php$ {
        deny all;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        include fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        #fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.3-fpm.sock;
        try_files $uri =404;
    }

    location ~* /\. {
        deny all;
    }
}
```

Thereafter your web server domens are:
``` 
http://online-store.site/ - for frontend
http://admin.online-store.site/ - for backend
```
5. Change the hosts file to point the domain to your server.
Path to hosts file in Linux: `/etc/hosts` and add the following lines:
```
127.0.0.1   frontend.test
127.0.0.1   backend.test
```
To login into the project, you need to first sign up, with any of your email address, username and password. Then, you can login into the application with same email address and password at any time. Enjoy :)
