                Meri founded The Shop Forward in 2014 with the simple idea of creating a platform to fundraise for
                important causes through apparel and accessories sales. Working with different charities has always
                been a huge part of Meri’s life, and after working for Marc Jacobs in New York City she decided to
                switch courses a little and combine her love of fashion and philanthropy. In Oct. 2016, she was
                named to Pepperdine's '40 under 40' list.
